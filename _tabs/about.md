## Hello and welcome to my blog!

I'm Shehan Silva, a veteran in End-User Computing (EUC) with a deep-rooted background in Citrix solutions, Windows services, and virtualization technologies. With years of hands-on experience in designing and optimizing Citrix and EUC environments, Iâ€™ve helped organizations enhance their digital workspaces and streamline IT operations.

As technology evolved, so did my expertise: transitioning into the Microsoft Cloud world, specializing in Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD), identity management, automation, and cloud-based EUC solutions. My journey has given me a unique perspective, bridging traditional on-prem EUC infrastructures with modern cloud-based workspaces.

Originally from Sri Lanka, I now call Norway home, balancing my passion for technology with my love for CrossFit. Whether it's fine-tuning virtual desktop solutions, optimizing Windows services, or pushing my limits in the Crossfit Box, I thrive on challenges and continuous learning.

I started this blog to share insights, technical deep dives, and practical solutions for cloud and EUC professionals. Whether you're a seasoned IT expert or just beginning your journey, I hope you find valuable knowledge here. ðŸš€
