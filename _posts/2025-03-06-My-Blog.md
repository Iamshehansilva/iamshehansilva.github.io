## ✍️ Starting My Blog Again 

I've been thinking about restarting my blog to share my tech journey and insights with the community. But for the longest time, I kept procrastinating 🤔, worried 🤷‍♂️ about how to build it, how to make it professional, visually appealing, and reader-friendly. Basically, I overthought the whole process. See the picture (Yes, Its a AI generated image and I added the text  😊) at the top? Yep, that’s me overthinking.

💡 My first blog was called  [Citrix Arena](https://shehanrsilva.blogspot.com/)

At one point, I even started coding my own blog template. I'm not a professional web developer, but I love learning by figuring things out hands-on. The beginning was exciting, but as bugs started creeping in and things didn’t meet my expectations, I ran out of time to fix them.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Discovering GitHub Pages

A good friend of mine, [Sabir Mohamed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sabirm/), suggested I should try GitHub Pages, but at first, I ignored completely it, as I was too eager to build everything myself. Eventually, I gave it a shot and gave it up as it wasn't quite what I needed and was too time consuming.

## 🔍 Why GitHub Pages?

As a Consultant/Engineer, I want to share useful knowledge with the community, because I’ve learned so much from others, and this is my way of giving back. But I don’t have the patience for complicated configurations.

I explored platforms like WordPress, Medium, and Google Blogger, but I ultimately went with Jekyll on GitHub Pages because I wanted:

- ✅ Full control over my blog
- ✅ A fast, easy-to-maintain solution that doesn't require hours of setup
- ✅ A free platform that doesn’t require paid hosting

I chose the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter/) theme because it’s simple and fits my style, but there are many Jekyll themes you can choose from:
- [Jekyllthemeio](https://jekyllthemes.io/)
- [Jekyllthemeorg](http://jekyllthemes.org/)

but there are more sites, you can simply explore what best for you.
